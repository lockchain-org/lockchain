# LUKS initrd assets (Sprint 3 scaffold)

This directory is reserved for provider-specific early-boot integration assets for the
`lockchain-luks` provider (ADR-003).

Planned targets:

- dracut module fragments
- initramfs-tools hooks/scripts
- keyscript helpers for `cryptsetup` + `/etc/crypttab`

Placeholders are intentional; implementation lands during the Sprint 3 boot integration work.
